# Dynamic_Programming
<p> Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map, etc.). Each subproblem solution is indexed in some way, typically based on its input parametersâ€™ values, to facilitate its lookup. So, the next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time. This technique of storing solutions to subproblems instead of recomputing them is called memoization</p>
